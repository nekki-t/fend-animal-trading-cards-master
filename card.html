            <p> The most distinct feature of Frilled lizard is the large ruff of skin which usually lies folded back against its head and neck.
                The neck frill is supported by long spines of cartilage which are connected to the jaw bones.
                When the lizard is frightened, it produces a startling deimatic display: it gapes its mouth,
                exposing a bright pink or yellow lining; it spreads out its frill, displaying bright orange and red scales;
                raises its body; and sometimes holds its tail above its body.
                This reaction is used for territorial displays, to discourage predators, and during courtship.
